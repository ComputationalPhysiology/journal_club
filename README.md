# Journal club

Here we will store the files for listing relevant papers for the
journal club.

Papers a organized in topics.
If you want to add a paper to an existing topic, then simply add the
bib-item to the relevant bib file.

To add a new topic, create a new bib-file and and edit the
`journal_club.tex` and `Makefile` accordingly.

To create a pdf type
```
make
```

We could potentially connect this to the Slack channel using e.g a
python API(
[bibtextparser](https://bibtexparser.readthedocs.io))
